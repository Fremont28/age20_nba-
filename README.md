Projecting 20-year old NBA seasons 

It’s said that draft picks are the building blocks of sustainable NBA franchises. But of course, not even most lottery picks live up to their hype and sometimes end up as rotation players or out of the league.

In this analysis, we are projecting 20-year old players’ value above replacement (VORP) for this upcoming season. We tested out different models including linear regression, elastic net, and gradient boosting and found that the latter model yielded the lowest mean squared error and root mean squared error.

Our gradient boosting model is trained on 214 age 20 player seasons since the 2000-2001 taking into account 23 variables including field goal attempt types (i.e. twos vs. threes), shot percentages, and defensive metrics.

In terms of VORP, the model really likes Jaren Jackson Jr. next season. As a rookie, analytics rated Jackson Jr. as an above average defender and a bit below average offensive threat. But at just 19, Jackson Jr. has already shown a smooth shooting stroke from beyond the arc and the ability to finish around the rim.
